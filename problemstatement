Problem Statement
What broke?

The client's endpoints now send data in JSON format, which is being stored in the rawData column of our employees table. Previously, data was stored in a tabular structure, so our application is unable to process the data correctly.
What do we need to do?

Extract the JSON data from the rawData column.
Populate the missing columns in the employees table so our application can continue working seamlessly with tabular data.
Goal:

Ensure that our app receives the data in the same tabular format it expects by parsing the JSON from rawData and transforming it back into structured columns.
